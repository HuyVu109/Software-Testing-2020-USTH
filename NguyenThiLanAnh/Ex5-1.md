Ex 5-1

Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2.
Futher suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.

a. Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2?

Yes. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption.

b. Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1?

No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.

c. If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the
fault.
