b. Give the path in the graph followed by each test.

• t1: [f1, f3, f5, f6]

• t2: [f1, f3, f4, f6]

• t3: [f1, f2]

• t4: [f1, f3, f4, f6]

• t5: [f1, f2, f3, f4, f6] 

c. Find a minimal test set that achieves Node Coverage.

Three possibilities: [t1; t2; t3], [t1; t3; t4], or [t1; t5].

d. Find a minimal test set that achieves Edge Coverage.

One possibility: [t1; t5]

e.  Give the prime paths in the graph. Which prime path is not covered by any of the tests above?

There are 4 prime paths:  

[f1, f2, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f2, f3, f5, f6], [f1,
f3, f4, f6], [f1, f3, f5, f6] . 

The second of these paths is not covered by the given test paths.
