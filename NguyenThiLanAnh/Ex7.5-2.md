Ex 7.5-2

a. How many states are there?

States: {wake, low}, {wake, high}, {sleep, low}, {sleep, high}

b. Draw and label the states (with variable values) and transitions (with method names).
Notice that all of the methods are total.

There are 12 edges (3 total methods each of which applies in 4 states). The initial states is (1).

c.A test case is simply a sequence of method calls. Provide a test set that satisfies Edge Coverage on your graph.
