Write the predicate (only the predicate) to represent the requirement:
- â€œList all the wireless mice that either retail for more than $100 or for which the store has more than 20 items."
- "Also list non-wireless mice that retail for more than $50."

- Case 1: (M V (p > 100) V (I > 20))
+ M
+ p > 100

+ -M
+ p > 50
