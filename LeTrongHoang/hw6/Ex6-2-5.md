Question
```
(a) Give tests to satisfy the Each Choice criterion.
(b) Give tests to satisfy the Base Choice criterion. Assume basechoices are Value 1 => 0, Value 2 => 0, and Operation = +.
(c) How many tests are needed to satisfy the All Combinations criterion? (Do not list all the tests.)
(d) Give tests to satisfy the Pair-Wise Coverage criterion.
```

Answer
```
(a) Four tests:

| V1 | V2 | Operation |
| -- | -- | --------- |
| -2 | -2 |     +     |
|  0 |  0 |     -     |
|  2 |  2 |     x     |
|  2 |  2 |     /     |

(b) Eight tests:

| V1 | V2 | Operation |
| -- | -- | --------- |
|  2 |  2 |     +     |
| -2 |  2 |     +     |
|  0 |  2 |     +     |
|  2 | -2 |     +     |
|  2 |  0 |     +     |
|  2 |  2 |     -     |
|  2 |  2 |     x     |
|  2 |  2 |     /     |

(c) 3*3*4 = 36 tests

(d) Since each test can accommodate 3 pairs, at least 11 tests are needed:

| V1 | V2 | Operation |
| -- | -- | --------- |
|  2 | -2 |     +     |
| -2 |  0 |     -     |
| -2 |  2 |     x     |
|  2 | -2 |     /     |
|  2 |  0 |     +     |
|  0 |  2 |     -     |
|  0 | -2 |     x     |
|  0 |  0 |     /     |
|  0 |  2 |     +     |
|  2 | -2 |    -      |
|  2 |  0 |     x     |

The best solution involves one extra test:
| -- | -- | --------- |
| -2 |  2 |     /     |
```
