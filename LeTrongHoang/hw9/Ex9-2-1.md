Question
```
Provide reachability conditions, infection conditions, propagation conditions, and test case values to kill mutants 2, 4, 5, and 6 in Figure 9.1
```

Answer
```
- ∆2 if (B > A)
    + R: Always reached.
	+ I: (B < A) != (B > A) ≡ A != B
	+ P: The infection will force a different path -> the infection will always propagate.

- ∆4 Bomb()
	+ R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
	+ I: Always infects.
	+ P: Always propagates.

- ∆5 minVal = A
	+ R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
	+ I: A != B
	+ P: Always propagates.



- ∆6 minVal = failOnZero (B)
	+ R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
	+ I: B = 0 (The exception is raised if the expression is zero)
	+ P: Always propagates.
