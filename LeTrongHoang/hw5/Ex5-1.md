Question
```
Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2.
Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test setT2 satisfies C2, also on P.
```

Answer
```
a) T1 need to satisfy C2. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption: All test requirements for C1 must be feasible with C2.

b) T2 doesn't need to satisfy C1. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.

c) Subsumption is about criteria, not about test sets. In particular, there is no requirement that test set T2 be a subset of test set T1. So, it could happen that T2 contains that one test that reveals the fault, and T1 doesn't.
