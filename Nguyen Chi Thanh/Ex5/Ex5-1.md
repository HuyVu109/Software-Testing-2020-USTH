Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P:

a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2 ? Explain.

b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1 ? Explain.

c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.

Answer:
a) Yes. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption. Test T1 satisfies C1 means T1 ⊂ C1, which implies T1 ⊂ C2, meaning T1 satisfies C2.

b) No, since T2 ⊂ C2 and C1 ⊂ C2. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2. 

c) Testers often think that test sets for strong criteria are at least as good at finding faults as test sets for weaker criteria. But subsumption is about criteria, not about test sets. In particular, there is no requirement that test set T2 be a subset of test set T1. So, it could happen that T2 contains that one test that reveals the fault, and T1 doesn't.
