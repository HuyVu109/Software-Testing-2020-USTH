2. A tester defined three characteristics based on the input parameter
car: Where Made, Energy Source, and Size. The following
partitionings for these characteristics have at least two mistakes.
Correct them.

Answer:
Where Made is not complete. Add “other”
Size overlaps, a hatch-back could be 2-door or 4-door. Either add “2-door + hatch-back,”
and “4-door + hatch-back,” or create two new characteristics:
Side Doors: 2, 4
Hatch-back: yes, no
