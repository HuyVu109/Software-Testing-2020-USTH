2. b) If you have never worked for a software development company, which of the four test activities do you think you are best qualified for?

I think I'll be most suitable for test execution as I'm not good at test designing and I can fairly compare results.
Furthermore, I've researched that test execution is the process of executing the code and comparing the expected and actual results. 
Following factors are to be considered for a test execution process:
Based on a risk, select a subset of test suite to be executed for this cycle.
- Assign the test cases in each test suite to testers for execution.
- Execute tests, report bugs, and capture test status continuously.
- Resolve blocking issues as they arise.
- Report status, adjust assignments, and reconsider plans and priorities daily.
- Report test cycle findings and status.
