4. Consider the following BNF:

A ::= O B | O M | O B M

O ::= "w" | "x" | "s" | "m"

B ::= "i" | "f" | "c" | "r"

M ::= "o" | "t" | "p" | "a" | "h"


Answer:

a) How many nonterminal symbols are in the grammar? 4

b) How many terminal symbols are in the grammar? 13

c) Write two strings that are valid according to the BNF. 116 possible strings, including: wio, xf

d) For each of your two strings, give two valid mutants of the string. Dozens for each string.

wio −→ wit, mio

xr −→ xi, sf

e) For each of your two strings, give two invalid mutants of the string. 

Thousands for each string.

wio −→ wir, pio

xr −→ fr, xm
