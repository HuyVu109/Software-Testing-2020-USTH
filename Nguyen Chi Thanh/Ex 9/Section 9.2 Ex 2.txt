2. Answer questions (a) through (d) for the mutant on line 5 in the method findVal().

a) If possible, find test inputs that do not reach the mutant.
Answer:
findVal: The mutant is always reached, even if x = null.
b) If possible, find test inputs that satisfy reachability but not infection for the mutant.
Answer:
findVal: Infection always occurs, even if x = null, because i always has the wrong
value after initialization in the loop.
c) If possible, find test inputs that satisfy reachability and infection, but not propagation
for the mutant.
Answer:
findVal: As long as the last occurrence of val isnâ€™t at numbers[0], the correct output is
returned. Examples are: (numbers, val) = ([1, 1], 1) or ([-1, 1], 1) or (null, 0).
d) If possible, find test inputs that strongly kill the mutants.
Answer:
findVal: Any input with val only in numbers[0] works. An example is: (numbers,
val) = ([1, 0], 1)
