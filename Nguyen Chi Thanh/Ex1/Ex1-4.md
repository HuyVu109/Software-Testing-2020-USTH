a)
public static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b)
{ 
  Vector result = new Vector (a);
  Iterator itr = b.iterator();
  while (itr.hasNext())
  {
    Object obj = itr.next();
    if (!a.contains (obj))
    {
      result.add();
    }
  }
  return result;
}

b) Many potential ambiguities exist. The method name suggest set union, but the argument types suggest otherwise.
 - What happens if the Vector is Null ?
 - What happens if an input Vector has Duplicates ?
 - What happens if an input Vector has Null entries ?
 - Are the inputs modified ?
 The choice of argument types and return types as Vector is suspect; best practice is to use the least specific type consistent with the specifier's goals.
