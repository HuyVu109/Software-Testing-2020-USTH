6. In Section 8.1.6, we introduced the example p = (a ∨ b) ∧ c, and
provided expanded versions of the clauses using program variables.
We then gave specific values to satisfy PC. We also gave truth values
to satisfy CC. Find values for the program variables given to satisfy
CC; that is, refine the abstract tests into concrete test values.

The predicate is:
p = (x < y ∨ done) ∧ list.contains(str)

For CC we have test value:
x = 1, y = 2 (x < y is true)
x = 2, y = 1 (x < y is false)
done is true
done is false
list = ["aa","bb","cc","dd"], str = "aa" ( list.contains(str) is true)
list = ["aa","bb","cc","dd"], str = "hieu" ( list.contains(str) is false)
