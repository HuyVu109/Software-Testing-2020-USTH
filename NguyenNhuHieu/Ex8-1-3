3. Write the predicate (only the predicate) to represent the requirement:
“List all the wireless mice that either retail for more than $100 or for
which the store has more than 20 items. Also list non-wireless mice
that retail for more than $50.”

The predicate is:
((mouse is wireless) ∧ ((price > 100) ∨ (stock > 20)))∨ ((mouse is not wireless) ∧ (price > 50))
