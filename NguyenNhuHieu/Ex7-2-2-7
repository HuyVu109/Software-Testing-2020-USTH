7. Answer questions aâ€“d for the graph defined by the following sets:
N = {1, 2, 3}
N 0 = {1}
N f = {3}
E = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)}
Also consider the following (candidate) paths:
p 1 = [1, 2, 3, 1]
p 2 = [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]
p 3 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3]
p 4 = [2, 3, 1, 3]
p 5 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]
(a) Which of the listed paths are test paths? For any path that is not
a test path, explain why not.
(b) List the eight test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage (only
the length two subpaths).
(c) Does the set of test paths from part (a) above satisfy Edge-Pair
Coverage? If not, state what is missing.
(d) Consider the prime path [3, 1, 3] and path p 2 . Does p 2 tour the
prime path directly? With a sidetrip?

(a)
test paths:p2,p3
p1 don't have Nf
p4 don't have N0
p5 have [3,2] not an edge

(b)
The test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage are:
[1,2,1], [1,2,3], [1,3,1], [2,1,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,1,3].

(c)
No, there is no [2,1,2], [3,1,3].

(d)
No.
Yes with sidetrip [1,2,1].
