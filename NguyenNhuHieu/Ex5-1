1. Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2 .Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set
T2 satisfies C2 , also on P.
(a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.
(b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.
(c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not
necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.

(a) Yes. Because of the definition of Criteria Subsumption : A test criterion C1 subsumes C2 if
and only if every set of test cases that satisfies criterion
C1 also satisfies C2.

(b) No. Because the opposite of it isn't true.

(c) Because Subsumption is only about criteria, not about test sets so T1 and T2 can be different from each others and so T2 reveals the fault but T1 does not.
