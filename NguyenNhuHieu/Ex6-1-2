2. A tester defined three characteristics based on the input parameter
car: Where Made, Energy Source, and Size. The following
partitionings for these characteristics have at least two mistakes. Correct them.
             Where Made
North America   Europe    Asia
            Energy Source
     gas       electric   hybrid
                 Size
2-door          4-door    hatch back


The two mistake I've seen here are:
 - Where Made didn't cover everything as there could be places other than the three, could add the remaining continent in like "Africa", "Australia", "South America" or add "Others".
 
 - The "2-door" and "4-door" characteristics shouldn't belong to the same input parameter as "hatch back" as we can have "2-door hatch back" and "4-door hatch back" so they should be seperated.
