5. Answer questions aâ€“g for the graph defined by the following sets:
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
N 0 = {1}
N f = {7}
E = {(1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1)}
Also consider the following (candidate) test paths:
p 1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]
p 2 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 7]
p 3 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]
(a) Draw the graph.
(b) List the test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage. (Hint: You
should get 12 requirements of length 2.)
(c) Does the given set of test paths satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage? If
not, state what is missing.
(d) Consider the simple path [3, 2, 4, 5, 6] and test path [1, 2, 3, 2,
4, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]. Does the test path tour the simple path
directly? With a sidetrip? If so, write down the sidetrip.
(e) List the test requirements for Node Coverage, Edge Coverage,
and Prime Path Coverage on the graph.
(f) List test paths from the given set that achieve Node Coverage
but not Edge Coverage on the graph.
(g) List test paths from the given set that achieve Edge Coverage
but not Prime Path Coverage on the graph.

(b)
 The 12 requirements are:
[1,2,3], [2,3,2], [3,2,3], [3,2,4], [2,4,5], [4,5,6], [5,6,1], [6,1,7],
[1,2,4],                            [2,4,6],          [4,6,1], [6,1,2].

 The test cases are:
[1,2,3,2,3,2,4,5,6,1,7],
[1,2,4,6,1,2,4,6,1,7].

(c)
 No because [3,2,3], [6,1,2] is missing.
 
(d)
      [3, 2, 4, 5, 6].
[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7].
 No, not directly.
 Yes, the side strip is:
 [6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6].

(e)
 The test requirements for Node Coverage are:
[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].
 The test requirements for Edge Coverage are:
[1,2], [1,7], [2,3], [2,4], [3,2], [4,5], [4,6], [5,6], [6,1].
 The test requirements for Prime Path Coverage are:
[1,2,4,6,1], [1,2,4,5,6,1], [2,3,2], [2,4,6,1,2], [2,4,5,6,1,2], 
[3,2,3], [3,2,4,6,1,7], [3,2,4,5,6,1,7], [4,5,6,1,2,4], [4,5,6,1,2,3], 
[4,6,1,2,4], [4,6,1,2,3], [5,6,1,2,4,5], [6,1,2,4,6], [6,1,2,4,5,6].
(f)
p 3 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]

(g)
None
