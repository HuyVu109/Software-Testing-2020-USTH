Suppose that coverage criterion C 1 subsumes coverage criterion C 2. 
Further suppose that test set T 1 satisfies C 1 on program P, and test set
T 2 satisfies C 2 , also on P.

(a) Does T 1 necessarily satisfy C 2 ? Explain.

(b) Does T 2 necessarily satisfy C 1 ? Explain.

(c) If P contains a fault, and T 2 reveals the fault, T 1 does not
necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.

(a) Yes. Because criterion C1 subsumes C2, so every set of test cases that 
satisfies criterion C1 also satisfies C2.

Eg: The test set satisfying the color jellybean criteria would also 
satisfy the flavor jellybean.

(b) No. Because there is no requirement that T2 satisfying C2 
would make T2 satisfy C1.

Eg: The test set satisfying the flavor jellybean criteria would not 
necessarily satisfy the color jellybean.

(c) Because there is no requirement that set T2 be a subset of T1. 
There could have T2 containing a test which reveals the fault, 
and doesn't happen for T1.
