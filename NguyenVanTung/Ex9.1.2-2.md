How is the mutation score related to coverage from Chapter 5?

[2014] Just et al. confirmed these suggestions by first showing a strong relation 
between coverage satisfaction and fault detection, and then going even further 
by showing that moving from node (statement) coverage to edge (branch) coverage 
increased fault detection power, and moving from edge to mutation coverage increased 
fault detection power even more.
