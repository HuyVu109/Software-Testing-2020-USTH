(a) “Location of element in list” fails the disjointness property. Give
an example that illustrates this.

(b) “Location of element in list” fails the completeness property.
Give an example that illustrates this.

(c) Supply one or more new partitions that capture the intent of
“Location of element in list” but do not suffer from
completeness or disjointness problems.

(a) search([3, 1, 3], 3)

(b) search([1, 2], 3)

(c) Block 3: Is somewhere in the list other than first and last: true/false
