Return to the example at the beginning of the chapter of the two
characteristics “File F sorted ascending” and “File F sorted
descending.” Each characteristic has two blocks. Give test case values
for all four combinations of these two characteristics.

* File F sorted ascending: asc

* File F not sorted ascending: nasc

* File F sorted descending: desc

* File F not sorted ascending: ndesc

|File F   |asc      |nasc     |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
|**desc** |"a"      |"c, b, a"|
|**ndesc**|"a, b, c"|"c, a, b"|
