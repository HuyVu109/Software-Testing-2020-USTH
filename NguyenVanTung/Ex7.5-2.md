For the following questions aâ€“c, consider the FSM that models a (simplified) programmable thermostat.
Suppose  the  variables  that  define  the  state  and  the  methods  that  transition between states are:

(a)  How many states are there?

(b)  Draw and label the states (with variable values) and transitions (with method names).Notice that all of the methods are total.

(c)  A test case is simply a sequence of method calls.  Provide a test set that satisfies Edge Coverage on your graph

(a) 4 states:

(1) Wake, Low

(2) Wake, High

(3) Sleep, Low

(4) Sleep, High

b)

advance()  (1) --> (3)

advance()  (3) --> (1)

advance()  (2) --> (4)

advance()  (4) --> (2)

up()  (1) --> (2)

up()  (3) --> (4)

up()  (2) --> (2)

up()  (4) --> (4)

down()  (1) --> (1)

down()  (3) --> (3)

down()  (2) --> (1)

down()  (4) --> (3)

(c) 

up() -> advance() (1, 2, 4)

advance() -> up() (1, 3, 4)

down() -> advance() (4, 3, 1)

advance() -> down() (4, 2, 1)
