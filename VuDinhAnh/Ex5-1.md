## Suppose
- Coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2.
- The test T1, T2 satisfy C1, C2 on program P.

## Answer
### a)
- Yes, T1 necessarily satisfy C2 because of pure definition of Criterion Subsumption.

Criterion Subsumption: A test criterion C1 subsumes C2 if and only if every set of test cases that satisfies criterion C1 also satisfies C2.

### b)
- No because the task did NOT mention that C2 subsumes C1.

### c)
- T2 can have different/special test case from T1. Therefore, that different/special one reveal the fault, despite the fact that it (test case) must satisfy criterion.
