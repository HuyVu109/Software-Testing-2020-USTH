# Ex6-4-1

The script provided in this [link](https://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/softwaretest/java/IteratorTest.java) by the authors is actually done.

The following characteristics have been identified and are used to generate tests for the methods:
- C1: iterator has more values
- C2: iterator returns a non-null object reference
- C3: remove() is supported
- C4: remove() precondition is satisfied
- C5: collection in consistent state while iterator in use
- Each characteristic has a boolean partition
