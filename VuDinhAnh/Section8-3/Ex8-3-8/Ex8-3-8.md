```Java
/* p1 */isPat == false && iSub + patternLen - 1 < subjectLen

/* p2 */subject.charAt(iSub) == pattern.charAt(0)

/* p3 */subject.charAt(iSub + iPat) != pattern.charAt(iPat)
```

The test cases for this program are simple:
- `subject = "hello", pattern = "ell"`
- `subject = "hello", pattern = "abc"`
- `subject = "", pattern = "e"`
- `subject = "e", pattern = ""`

Surely these test cases ensure reachability.

There are loops hence, it's hard to determine values of predicates and clauses.
Therefore, a), b), c), d) have same test sets.
