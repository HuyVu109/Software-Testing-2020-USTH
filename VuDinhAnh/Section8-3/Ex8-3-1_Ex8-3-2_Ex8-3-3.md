# Ex8-3-1 & Ex8-3-2 & Ex8-3-3

For the Thermostat class, complete and run the tests to satisfy:
- PC (predicate coverage)
- CC (clause coverage)
- CACC (correlated Active Clause Coverage)

```Java
/* p1 */((curTemp < dTemp - thresholdDiff) || (override && curTemp < overTemp - thresholdDiff))
        && (timeSinceLastRun > minLag)
        
/* p2 */override
```
