 Graph I:
(b) x has 5 du-paths, as enumerated below:
i [1, 2, 8]
ii [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
iii [4, 3, 5, 6]
iv [4, 3, 5, 7, 2, 8]
v [4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8]
(c) The numbers in the table below correspond to the du-paths in the previous table. The
table indicates whether each test path tours each du-path with or without a sidetrip.
direct w/ sidetrip
t1 i
t2 i
t3 ii i
t4 iv
t5 iii, v
t6 iii, iv, v
(d) This question has multiple possible answers. Either t1 or t3 can be used to directly tour
a path that satisfies all-defs for the def at node 0, and either t4 or t5 can be used to
directly tour a path that satisfies all-defs for the def at node 3.
Possible answers: {t1, t4} or {t1, t5} or {t3, t4} or {t3, t5}
(e) This question only has one possible answer: {t1, t3, t5}
(f ) This question only has one possible answer: {t1, t3, t4, t5}
 Graph III
(b) x has 6 du-paths, as enumerated below:
i [1, 2, 3]
ii [1, 2, 3, 5]
iii [1, 2, 6]
iv [4, 5]
v [4, 5, 2, 3]
vi [4, 5, 2, 6]
(c) The numbers in the table below correspond to the du-paths in the previous table. The
table indicates whether each test path tours each du-path with or without a sidetrip.
direct w/ sidetrip
t1 i, ii iii
t2 i, iv, vi
Note that neither t1 nor t2 tours du-path (v), either directly or with a sidetrip. Also
note that neither t1 nor t2 tours du-path (iii) directly. t1 does tour du-path (iii) with a
sidetrip. But t2 does not tour du-path (iii) with a sidetrip; the problem is the def of x
in node 4.
(d) This question has one possible answer: {t2}.
(e) For all-uses, all six du-paths must be toured. Since the given test set does not have a
test path that directly tours either of du-paths (iii) or (v), this question is unsatisfiable.
To directly tour the given du - paths, we would two additional test paths. An example
all-uses adequate test set (direct touring) is: {t1, t2, [1, 2, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 6]}.
(f ) For this exercise, all-du-paths coverage is the same as all-uses coverage. The reason is
that there is only one du-path for each du-pair.
