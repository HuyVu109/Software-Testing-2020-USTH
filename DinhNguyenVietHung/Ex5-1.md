# Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.

## (a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain

Yes, due to the C1's nature as a subsume of C2, T1 would satisfy C2

## (b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.

No. The requirements for C2 is broader then C1, so T2 can't satisfy C1.

## (c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.

Because of the broader scale of the criteria, the T2 also covers a wider range of problems so that the bug can be found, that is why T1 isn't able to
