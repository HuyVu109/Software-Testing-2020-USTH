Use the following program fragment for questions aâ€“e below. Use the following test inputs:
 t1 = f1 (0, 0) t2 = f1 (1, 1) t3 = f1 (0, 1) t4 = f1 (3, 2) t5 = f1 (3, 4) 
a) Draw the call graph for this program fragment.
b) Give the path in the graph followed by each test.
c) Find a minimal test set that achieves Node Coverage.
d) Find a minimal test set that achieves Edge Coverage.
e) Give the prime paths in the graph. Which prime path is not covered by any of the tests above?

a)graph:

b)
 t1: [f1, f3, f5, f6] 
 t2: [f1, f3, f4, f6] 
 t3: [f1, f2] 
 t4: [f1, f3, f4, f6] 
 t5: [f1, f2, f3, f4, f6]

c) 3 Node coverage {t1, t2, t3}, {t1, t3, t4}, or {t1, t5}.

d) 1 Edge coverage {t1, t5}

e) 4 prime paths: {[f1, f2, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f2, f3, f5, f6], [f1, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f3, f5, f6]}.
