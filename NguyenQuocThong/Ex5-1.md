Suppose that coverage criterionC1subsumes coverage criterionC2.
Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.
(a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2?  Explain.
Yes.  This follows directly from the definition of subsumption.
(b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1?  Explain.
No. Because there is no requirement that T2 satisfying C2 
would make T2 satisfy C1.
(c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault.  Explain.
T2 could have containing a test which reveals the fault, but T1 don't have
