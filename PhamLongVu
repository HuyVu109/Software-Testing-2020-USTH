"Level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk" is the process of reduce faults to reduce the bad effects of them in the future.

Risk here can be:

The resources using to debugging.
The reduce of benefits obtained from the program.
The risk can never be reduce to zero since there is impossible to test all the test cases.
Ex1-4.
a.

public static Vector union(Vector v1, Vector v2)
{
    Vector v3 = new Vector();
    v3.addAll(v1);
    v3.addAll(v2);
    return v3;
}
b. The program will return error if v1 or v2 is NULLL.

c. Test cases:

Test[1]:

Vector v1 = new Vector();
Vector v2 = new Vector();
Test[2]:

Vector v1 = new Vector();
v1.add(1);
Vector v2 = new Vector();
Test[3]:

Vector v1 = new Vector();
Vector v2 = new Vector();
v2.add(1);
d.

public static Vector union(Vector v1, Vector v2)
{
	if (v1.isEmpty() || v2.isEmpty()) {
		return NULL;
	} else {
   		Vector v3 = new Vector();
    	v3.addAll(v1);
    	v3.addAll(v2);
    	return v3;
	}
}
