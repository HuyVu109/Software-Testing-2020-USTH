From the same book, right after criterion 9.4, mutation score is "The amount of coverage is usually written as the ratio of mutants killed over all mutants"
Ex9.1.2
In chapter 5, section 5.5 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES,

[Andrews et al., 2006] suggested a strong positive correlation between the mutation score of a test set and the degree to which that test set detected actual faults. 

Just et al. [Just et al., 2014] confirmed these suggestions by first showing a strong relation between coverage satisfaction and fault detection, and then going even further by showing that moving from node (statement) coverage to edge (branch) coverage increased fault detection power, and moving from edge to mutation coverage increased fault detection power even more.
