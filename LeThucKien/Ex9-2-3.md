(b) If possible, find test inputs that satisfy reachability but not infection for the mutant. (c) If possible, find test inputs that satisfy infection, but not propagation for the mutant. (d) If possible, find test inputs that strongly kill the mutants.

a) sum: If x is null or the empty array, ie x = null or [], then the mutant is never
reached.

b) sum: Any input with all zeroes will reach but not infect. Examples are: x = [0] or [0, 0].

c) sum: Any input with nonzero entries, but with a sum of zero, is fine. Examples are: x = [1, -1] or [1, -3, 2].

d) sum: Any input with a nonzero sum works. An example is: x = [1, 2, 3].
