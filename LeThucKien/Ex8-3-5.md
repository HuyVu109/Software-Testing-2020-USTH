5. Answer the following questions for the method checkIt() below: (a) Transform checkIt() to checkItExpand(), a method where each if statement tests exactly one boolean variable. Instrument checkItExpand() to record which edges are traversed. (“print” statements are fine for this.) (b) Derive a GACC test set T1 for checkIt(). Derive an Edge Coverage test set T2 for checkItExpand(). Build T2 so that it does not satisfy GACC on the predicate in checkIt(). (c) Run both T1 and T2 on both checkIt() and checkItExpand().

a)
~~~java
public static void checkItExpand (boolean a, boolean b, boolean c) {
	if (a) {
		if (b) {
			System.out.println ("1: P is true");
		}
		else if (c) {
			System.out.println ("2: P is true");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println ("3: P isn’t true");
		}
	}
	else {
		System.out.println ("4: P isn’t true");
	}
}
