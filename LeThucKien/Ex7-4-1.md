1. Use the class Watch in Figures 7.38 and 7.39 in Section 7.5 to answer questions a–d below. (a) Draw control flow graphs for the methods in Watch. (b) List all the call sites. (c) List all coupling du-pairs for each call site. (d) Create test data to satisfy All-Coupling-Use Coverage for Watch.

b) The call sites are: 
1.  Line 62, Watch::constructor() → Time:constructor() 
2. Line 63, Watch::constructor() → Time:constructor() 
3. Line 64, Watch::constructor() → Time:constructor() 
4. Line 69, Watch::toString() → Time:toString() 
3. Line 70, Watch::toString() → Time:toString() 
6. Line 70, Watch::toString() → Time:toString() 
7. Line 82, Watch::doTransition() → Time:changeTime()
8. Line 88, Watch::doTransition() → Time:changeTime()
9. Line 94, Watch::doTransition() → Time:changeTime()

d)

2. t2: mode = TIME, button = UP, UP, ..., UP60
3. t3: mode = TIME, button = UP1440
4. t4: mode = TIME, button = DOWN
5. t5: mode = TIME, button = DOWN60
6. t6: mode = TIME, button = DOWN1440
7. t7: mode = STOPWATCH, button = UP
8. t8: mode = STOPWATCH, button = UP60
9. t9: mode = STOPWATCH, button = UP1440
10. t10: mode = STOPWATCH, button = DOWN
11. t11: mode = STOPWATCH, button = DOWN60
12. t12: mode = STOPWATCH, button = DOWN1440
13. t13: mode = ALARM, button = UP
14. t14: mode = ALARM, button = UP60
