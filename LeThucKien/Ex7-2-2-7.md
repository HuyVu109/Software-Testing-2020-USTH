7. Answer questions a–d for the graph defined by the following sets: N = {1, 2, 3} N0 = {1} Nf = {3} E = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)} Also consider the following (candidate) paths: p1 = [1, 2, 3, 1] p2 = [1, 3, 1, 2, 3] p3 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3] p4 = [2, 3, 1, 3] p5 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3] (a) Which of the listed paths are test paths? For any path that is not a test path, explain why not. (b) List the eight test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage (only the length two subpaths). (c) Does the set of test paths from part (a) above satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage? If not, state what is missing. (d) Consider the prime path [3, 1, 3] and path p2 . Does p2 tour the prime path directly? With a sidetrip?

a) Test paths are p2 and p3. Others are not since test paths should begin with the initial node and end with final node, also p5 has a path [3,2] which doesnt exist in the edge set.

b) {[1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 3]}

c) No. Neither p2 nor p3 tours either of the following edge-pairs: {[2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 3]}

d) p3 does not directly tour the prime path. However, p3 does tour the prime path with the sidetrip [1, 2, 1].
