2. A tester defined three characteristics based on the input parameter car: Where Made, Energy Source, and Size. The following partitionings for these characteristics have at least two mistakes. Correct them. 

|               	| Where made 	|      	|
|:-------------:	|:----------:	|:----:	|
| North America 	|   Europe   	| Asia 	|


|     	| Energy source 	|        	|
|:---:	|:-------------:	|:------:	|
| Gas 	|    Electric   	| Hybrid 	|

|        	|  Size  	|            	|
|:------:	|:------:	|:----------:	|
| 2-door 	| 4-door 	| Hatch Back 	|



- First mistake that this partitioning makes is it doesnt cover all the domain. For instance, the "Where made" table can have more than 3 mentioned locations such as Australia or South America and so on. This violates the completeness property of the partition.
- Second mistake is that the partitioning doesnt satisfy the disjoint property either. For instance, hatch back cars can have both 4 doors or 2 doors.
