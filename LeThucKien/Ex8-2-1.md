1. Use predicates (i) through (iv) to answer the following questions. i. f = abc + abc ii. f = abcd + abcd iii. f = ab + abc + abc iv. f = acd + cd + bcd (a) Draw the Karnaugh maps for f and f. (b) Find the nonredundant prime implicant representation for f and f. (c) Give a test set that satisfies Implicant Coverage (IC) for f. (d) Give a test set that satisfies Multiple Unique True Points (MUTP) for f. (e) Give a test set that satisfies Corresponding Unique True Point and Near False Point Pair Coverage (CUTPNFP) for f. (f) Give a test set that satisfies Multiple Near False Points (MNFP) for f. (g) Give a test set that is guaranteed to detect all faults in Figure 8.2.

Karnaugh maps for f
  

| c\a, b | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |

| **0** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| **1** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

  

Karnaugh maps for ¯f

| c\a, b | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
|:------:|----|----|----|----|
| **0** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| **1** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Nonredundant prime implicant representation for f: f=b ̄c
Nonredundant prime implicant representation for ̄f:  ̄f= ̄b+c
f is a function of b and c only ; a is irrelevant.

  

c)
implicants {b ̄c, ̄b, c} in f and ̄f
Test set {xT F, xF T} satisfies IC
  
e)
Test set {xTF, xFF, xTT} sastifies CUTPNFP
