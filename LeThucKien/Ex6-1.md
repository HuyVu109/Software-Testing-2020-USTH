1. Return to the example at the beginning of the chapter of the two characteristics “File F sorted ascending” and “File F sorted descending.” Each characteristic has two blocks. Give test case values for all four combinations of these two characteristics.

- Test case 1: F = {0}:
		- F file sorted ascending: True
		- F file sorted descending: True
- Test case 2: F = {1, 3, 2, 8}
		- F file sorted ascending: False
		- F file sorted descending: False
- Test case 3: F = {1, 2, 3, 4}
		- F file sorted ascending: True
		- F file sorted descending: False
- Test case 4: F = {4, 3, 2, 1}
		- F file sorted ascending: False
		- F file sorted descending: True
