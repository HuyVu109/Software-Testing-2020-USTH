(b) If possible, find test inputs that satisfy reachability but not infection for the mutant. (c) If possible, find test inputs that satisfy infection, but not propagation for the mutant. (d) If possible, find test inputs that strongly kill the mutants.

a) findVal: The mutant is always reached

b) findVal: Infection always occurs,because i always has the wrong value after initialization in the loop

c) findVal: As long as the last occurrence of val isn’t at numbers[0], the correct output isreturned
