5. Again consider the pattern matching example in Figure 7.25. Instrument the code to produce the execution paths reported in the text for this example. That is, on a given test execution, your tool should compute and print the corresponding test path. Run the following three test cases and answer questions a-g below: subject = “brown owl” pattern = “wl” expected output = 7 subject = “brown fox” pattern = “dog” expected output = -1 subject = “fox” pattern = “brown” expected output = -1 (a) Find the actual path followed by each test case. (b) For each path, give the du-paths that the path tours in the table at the end of Section 7.3. To reduce the scope of this exercise, consider only the following du-paths: du (10, iSub), du (2, isPat), du (5, isPat), and du (8, isPat). (c) Explain why the du-path [5, 6, 10, 3, 4] cannot be toured by any test path. (d) Select tests from the table at the end of Section 7.3 to complete coverage of the (feasible) du-paths that are uncovered in question (a). (e) From the tests above, find a minimal set of tests that achieves All-Defs Coverage with respect to the variable isPat. (f) From the tests above, find a minimal set of tests that achieves All-Uses Coverage with respect to the variable isPat. (g) Is there any difference between All-Uses Coverage and all DUPaths Coverage with respect to the variable isPat in the pat() method?

a)
- t1: java PatternIndexInstrument "brown owl" wl Pattern string begins at the character 7 Path is [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 6, 10, 3, 11]
- t2: java PatternIndexInstrument "brown fox" dog Pattern string is not a substring of the subject string Path is [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 4, 10, 3, 11]
- t3: java PatternIndexInstrument fox brown Pattern string is not a substring of the subject string Path is [1, 2, 3, 11]

c) Since the value if isPat is set to true in node 5 and not reset on the path [6, 10, 3], the next node must be 11, not 4. Hence the du path [5, 6, 10, 3, 4] is infeasible.

d) The given tests do not directly tour the following 3 (feasible) du-paths: [10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10], [5, 6, 10, 3, 11], and [8, 10, 3, 11]. According to Table 7.5, tests (ab,b), (ab,a), and (ab,ac) respectively tour these du-paths directly. Note that Best Effort touring requires a direct tour of each feasible du-path.

e) Since direct tours are possible, we leave out the sidetrip information in this version of the table.

<br>
For All-Defs (Best Effort Touring) with respect to isPat, we need to tour 3 du-paths, starting with, respectively, nodes 2, 5, and 8. Possible minimal sets are: {t1, (ab, b)}, {t1, (ab, a)}, {(ab, b), (ab, ac)}, or {(ab, a), (ab, ac)}.

f) {t1, t3 (ab, b), (ab, ac)} or {t1, t3 (ab, a), (ab, ac)}.

g)No. The test requirements are the same with respect to isPat.
