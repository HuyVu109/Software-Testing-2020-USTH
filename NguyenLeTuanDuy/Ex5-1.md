## Exercise 1

### (a)
T1 necessarily satisfy C2, since C1 subsumes C2, all of test set that satisfies C1 will also satisfies C2.

### (b)
T2 may not satisfy C1, since C1 contain all conditions that C2 has and may also addition conditions that C2 doesnt has. C1 subsumes C2 not mean C2 will subsume C1.

### (c)
It is possible for this to explain. Since T2 reveals the fault, and T1, which has more conditions than T2 (because C1 is "Bigger"), and this more conditions may lead to the fault not be revealed.
