## a)

- Node Coverage

{(1,4,8), (2,5,9,6), (3,7,10)}

- Edge Coverage

{(1,4,8), (1,5,8), (2,5,9,6,2), (3,6,10), (3,7,10)}

- Prime Path Coverage

{(1,4,8), (1,5,8), (1,5,9,6,2), (2,5,9,6,2), (3,6,10), (3,7,10), (3,6,2,5,9), (3,6,2,5,8), (2,5,8)}

## b) Test paths that achieve Node Coverage but not Edge Coverage: All of the paths in part a node coverage.

## c)

Test paths that achieve Edge Coverage but not Prime PathCoverage: All of the paths in part a edge coverage.
