## a)

Test T1 can satisfy C2 since it already satisfies C1, which is bigger than C2.

## b)

Test T2 cannot satisfy C1 since T2 can only satisfy T2, which is a smaller set than T1.

## c)

I personally do not think that is possible. The definition of subsumption states that to T1 can only be satisfied if T2 is satisfied, therefore T1 can also reveal the fault which T2 can.
