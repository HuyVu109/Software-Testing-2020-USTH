### (a):
	Yes. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption.
### (b):
	No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2
### (c):
	No. This is the hard question. Testers often think that test sets for strong criteria are at least as good at finding faults as test sets for weaker criteria. But subsumption is about criteria, not about test sets. In particular, there is no requirement that test set T2 be a subset of test set T1. So, it could happen that T2 contains that one test that reveals the fault, and T1 doesn't.
