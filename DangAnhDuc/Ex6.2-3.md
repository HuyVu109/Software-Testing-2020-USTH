# Chapter 6 - Section 2 - Exercise 3

### Base tests: (2,2,2), (1,2,2)

## Tests based on the first base test:
(2,2,2)
(0,2,2), (-1,2,2)
(2,-1,2), (2,0,2), (2,1,2)
(2,2,-1), (2,2,0), (2,2,1)

## Test based on the seconde base test:
(1,2,2)
(0,2,2), (-1,2,2)
(1,-1,2), (1,0,2), (1,1,2)
(1,2,-1), (1,2,0), (1,2,1)

There are 2 repeated tests which are (0,2,2) and (-1,2,2) so in total, there would be 16 tests.
