# Chapter 7 - Section 2 - Subsection 2 - Exercise 8

If you look in the course [website](https://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/softwaretest/), you will find a [web app](https://cs.gmu.edu:8443/offutt/coverage/GraphCoverage) that does exactly what the exercise asks. Since it has been done well, I'm not going to redo it, just like how the professor let us study the course by ourself because all the materials are well done.
