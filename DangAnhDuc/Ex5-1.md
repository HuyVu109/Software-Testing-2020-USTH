# Chapter 5 - Exercise 1

## (a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? 
- Yes, this follows directly from the definition of subsumption.

## (b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1?
- No. T2 does not have to satisfied the test requirements generated by C1.

## (c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault
- Subsumption is about criteria and not about test sets. There is no requirement saying that test set T2 is a subset of T1. Therefore, it is possible that T2 contains a test that reveals fault and T1 doesn't.
