# Chapter 8 - Section 1 - Exercise 3

## “List all the wireless mice that either retail for more than $100 or for
which the store has more than 20 items. Also list non-wireless mice
that retail for more than $50.”

### The predicate describing the given statement:
((mouseType = wireless) ∧ ((retail > 100) ∨ (stock > 20))) ∨ (!(mouseType = wireless) ∧ (retail > 50))

** Since I can't find out how to use the negation syntax so I use "!" instead **
