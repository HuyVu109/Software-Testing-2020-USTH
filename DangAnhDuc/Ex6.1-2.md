# Chapter 6 - Section 6.1 - Exercise 2

In my opinion, The two mistakes in the given paritionings are:

## Where made:
- North America, Europe and Asia are not complete. The car can be made in other places so we should add "Other" for this characteristics

## Size:
- A hatch-back can either be 2-door or 4-door so these overlapped. We can change the blocks to "2-door + hatchback" and "4-door + hatchback"
