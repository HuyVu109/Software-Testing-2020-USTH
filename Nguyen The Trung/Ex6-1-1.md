```
There are 4 possibilities:
+ Test case 1: F = {0}:
		- F file sorted ascending: True
		- F file sorted descending: True
+ Test case 2: F = {1, 3, 2, 4}
		- F file sorted ascending: False
		- F file sorted descending: False
+ Test case 3: F = {1, 2, 3, 4}
		- F file sorted ascending: True
		- F file sorted descending: False
+ Test case 4: F = {4, 3, 2, 1}
		- F file sorted ascending: False
		- F file sorted descending: True

Which means:
TT: cat
FF: dog, cat, possum
TF: cat, dog
FT: dog, cat
