T Rnc = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
T Rec = {(1,4),(1,5),(2,5),(3,6),(3,7),(4,8),(5,8),(5,9),(6,2),(6,10),(7,10),(9,6)}
T Rppc = {[1,4,8],[1,5,8],[1,5,9,6,2],[1,5,9,6,10],[2,5,9,6,2],[2,5,9,6,10],[3,6,2,5,8],[3,6,2,5,9],[3,6,10],[3,7,10],[5,9,6,2,5],[6,2,5,9,6],[9,6,2,5,8],[9,6,2,5,9 }

b.

T Node Coverage = {[1,4,8], [2,5,9,6,10], [3,7,10]}
Although T Node Coverage visits all nodes, T Node Coverage does not tour edges (1,5), (5,7), (6,1) and (3,6)

c.

T Edge Coverage = T Node Coverage U {[1,4,8], [3,6,2,5,8]}
Although T Edge Coverage tours all edges, T Edge Coverage does not tour prime paths [1,5,9,6,2], [2,5,9,6,2], [3,6,2,5,9], [2,6,10], [5,8,5,2,5], [5,1,6,9,6], [9,6,2,5,8], or [9,6,2,5,9]

7.2.2.7
a. 
p2 and p3 are test paths.p1 does not terminate at a final node. p4 does not start at an initial node. p5 includes an edge that does not exist in the graph (3,2).

b.
 The edge pairs are:
 {[1,2,1],[1,2,3],[1,3,1],[2,1,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,1,3]}

 c.
  No. Neither p2 nor p3 tours either of the following edge-pairs:
  {[2,1,2],[3,1,3]}

  d.
  p3 does not directly tour the prime path. However, p3 does tour the prime path with the sidetrip[1,2,1]
