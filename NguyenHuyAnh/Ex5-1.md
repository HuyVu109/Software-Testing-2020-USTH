a/ Yes. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption.

b/ Yes. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption.

c/ No. This is the hard question. Students often think that test sets for strong criteria are
at least as good at finding faults as test sets for weaker criteria. But subsumption is
about criteria, not about test sets. In particular, there is no requirement that test set T2
be a subset of test set T1. So, it could happen that T2 contains that one test that reveals
the fault, and T1 doesn't.
