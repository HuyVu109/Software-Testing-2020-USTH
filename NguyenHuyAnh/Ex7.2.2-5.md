a. Graph:
1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 2
2 -> 4
4 -> 6
4 -> 5
5 -> 6
6 -> 1
1 -> 7

b. For this program, this is not possible. All test paths must begin at node 1, visit node 2, and, eventually, end at node 4. Any test path that visits node 3 also visits both edge(2,3) and edge(3,2)

c. T={[1,2,3,2,4]}

d. T={[1,2,4],[1,2,3,2,3,2,4]}
