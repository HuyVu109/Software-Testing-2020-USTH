### Ex 6-1-2
The partitionings for 3 characteristics have the following mistakes:
#### Where made:
* Should add "other" for cars not made from the listed locations.
#### Size:
* The 2-door, 4-door, hatch back not define the size of the car at the same time 2-door, 4-door car can still have hatch back.
* We can devide size into 2 characteristics: Side door(2|4), Hatch back(Yes|No).
