### Ex 7-4-4

#### a)
The call site is at line 12: int o = takeOut (m, n) (trash() -> takeOut()) 

#### b)
Pairs of last-defs and first-uses:
* trash(), line 5, m  -> takeOut(), line 19, a (1)
* trash(), line 7, m -> takeOut(), line 19, a (2)
* trash(), line 9, n -> takeOut(), line 21, b (3)
* trash(), line 9, n -> takeOut(), line 23, b (4)
* trash(), line 11, n -> takeOut(), line 21, b (5)
* trash(), line 11, n -> takeOut(), line 23, b (6)
* takeOut(), line 21, e -> trash(), line 13, o (7)
* takeOut(), line 23, e -> trash(), line 13, o (8)

#### c)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are the uses called in b)
* x = 0: satisfies 1, 6, 8
* x = 1: satisfies 2, 5, 7
* x = 6: satisfies 2, 3, 7
* 4 cannot be satisfied because if trash() x > 5, m = 4, then takeOut() x will be greater than 0.
