### Ex 6-1-3
* a) “Location of element in list” fails the disjointness property is true since disjointess property states that no element of domain is in more than one block.
Ex: If the list has only one element then the element will be in all three blocks --> disjointness is not satisfied.
* b) “Location of element in list” fails the completeness property is true since it the partition can't cover the entire domain.
Ex: If the list has no element then it won't stay in any block.
* c) Splitting into two characteristics, namely first entry and last entry, solves the problem.
