### Ex 9-2-1

#### ∆2 if (B > A)
* R: always reached. 
* I: (B < A) != (B > A) ≡ A != B
* P: The infection will force a different path -> the infection will always propagate.

#### ∆4 Bomb()
* R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
* I: always infects.
* P: always propagates.

#### ∆5 minVal = A
* R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
* I: A != B
* P: always propagates.

#### ∆6 minVal = failOnZero (B)
* R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
* I: B = 0 (The exception is raised if the expression is zero)
* P: always propagates.
