### Ex 7-4-3

#### a) 

#### b)

The path in the graph followed by each test:
* t1: [f1, f3, f5, f6]
* t2: [f1, f3, f4, f6] 
* t3: [f1, f2]
* t4: [f1, f3, f4, f6]
* t5: [f1, f2, f3, f4, f6]

#### c)
Minimal test set that achieves Node Coverage:
* {t1, t2, t3}
* {t1, t3, t4}
* {t1, t5}

#### d)
Minimal test set that achieves Edge Coverage:
* {t1, t5}

#### e)
* 4 prime paths: {[f1, f2, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f2, f3, f5, f6], [f1, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f3, f5, f6]}
* [f1, f2, f3, f5, f6]  is not covered by any of the test paths above.
