Inheritance hierarchy can complicate the process of testing the objects and hence impacts the controllability as well as observability. The correct behavior os the system gets affected by the inheritance. 
The controllability , as well as observability ,happens to be a factor of the reusability ,maintainability. The variables get affected by the control inputs and hence the controllability gets affected by the inheritance process
