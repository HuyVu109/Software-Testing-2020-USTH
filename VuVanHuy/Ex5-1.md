1. Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.

a.  Yes. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption.
b.  No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.
c.  In particular, there is no requirement that test set T2
be a subset of test set T1. So, it could happen that T2 contains that one test that reveals the fault, and T1 doesnâ€™t.
