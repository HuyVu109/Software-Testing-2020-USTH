a, 
The mutant is always reached, even if x = null

b, 
Infection always occurs, even if x = null, because i always has the wrong value after initialization in the loop

c,
As long as the the last occurence of val isn't at numbers[0], the correct output is returned
Example : (number, val) = ([1, 1], 1)

d,
Any input with val only in numbers[0] works.
Example: (numbers, val) = ([1, 0], 1)
