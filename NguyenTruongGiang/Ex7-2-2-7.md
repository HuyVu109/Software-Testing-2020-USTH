# Exercise 7 - Section 2.2 - Chapter 7

## Question
Answer questions aâ€“d for the graph defined by the following sets:
- N = {1, 2, 3}
- N0 = {1}
- Nf = {3}
- E = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)}
Also consider the following (candidate) paths:
- p1 = [1, 2, 3, 1]
- p2 = [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]
- p3 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3]
- p4 = [2, 3, 1, 3]
- p5 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]  

*The graph can be found [**here**](https://cs.gmu.edu:8443/offutt/coverage/GraphCoverage?edges=1+2%0D%0A1+3%0D%0A2+1%0D%0A2+3%0D%0A3+1%0D%0A&initialNode=1&endNode=3&action=Nodes)*

### Which of the listed paths are test paths? For any path that is not a test path, explain why not.
Only *p2* and *p3* are test path. For other path:  
- p1: Does not end at final node.  
- p4: Does not start at initial node.  
- p5: [3, 2] is not an edge.  

### List the eight test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage (only the length two subpaths).
1. [1,2,1]  
2. [1,2,3]  
3. [1,3,1]  
4. [2,1,2]  
5. [2,1,3]  
6. [2,3,1]  
7. [3,1,2]  
8. [3,1,3]  

### Does the set of test paths from part (a) above satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage? If not, state what is missing.
No. None of the paths tour {[2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 3]}  

### Consider the prime path [3, 1, 3] and path p2. Does p2 tour the prime path directly? With a sidetrip?
The path *p2* tours the prime path with a sidetrip [1, 2, 3].
