# Exercise 1 - Chapter 5

## Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2.Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.

### Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.
According to the definition of **Criteria Subsumption**, T1 does satisfy C2.

### Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.
No. Since C1 subsumes C2, there is no proof that T2 satisfy C1.

### If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.
No. I think because C1 subsumes C2 does not mean T2 is a subset of T1.
