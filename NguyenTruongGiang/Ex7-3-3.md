# Exercise 3 - Section 3 - Chapter 7

## Question
Consider the pattern matching example in Figure 7.25. Instrument the code to produce the execution paths in the text for this example. That is, on a given test execution, your instrumented program should compute and print the corresponding test path. Run the instrumented program on the test cases listed at the end of Section 7.3.
