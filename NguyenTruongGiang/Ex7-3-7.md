# Exercise 7 - Section 3 - Chapter 7

## Question
Use the method printPrimes() for questions aâ€“f below. A compilable version is available on the book website in the file PrintPrimes.java. A line-numbered version suitable for this exercise is available on the book website in the file PrintPrimes.num.

## Answer
### Draw the control flow graph for the printPrimes() method.
![Graph](./resource/Ex7-3-7)

### Consider test cases t1 = (n = 3) and t2 = (n = 5). Although these tour the same prime paths in printPrimes(), they do not necessarily find the same faults. Design a simple fault that t2 would be more likely to discover than t1 would.
*I do not know how to do this*

### For printPrimes(), find a test case such that the corresponding test path visits the edge that connects the beginning of the while statement to the for statement without going through the body of the while loop.
The test case n = 1 would do since *while(numPrimes < 1)*, with *numPrimes = 1* will not run the loop.

### List the test requirements for Node Coverage, Edge Coverage, and Prime Path Coverage.
- Node Coverage: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}  
- Edge Coverage: {(0,1) (1,2), (1,10), (2,3), (3,4), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (6,3), (5,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,1), (10,11), (11,12), (11,14), (12,13), (13,11)}  
- Prime Path Coverage: {[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6], [0, 1, 10, 11, 12, 13], [0, 1, 10, 11, 14], [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 1]}

### List test paths that achieve Node Coverage but not Edge Coverage on the graph.
*I can not find any*
