# Exercise 3 - Section 3 - Chapter 7

## Question
Consider the pattern matching example in Figure 7.25. In particular, consider the final table of tests in Section 7.3. Consider the variable iSub. Number the (unique) test cases, starting at 1, from the top of theiSub part of the table. For example, (ab, c, -1), which appears twice in the iSub portion of the table, should be labeled test t4.  
1. Give a minimal test set that satisfies all defs coverage. Use the test cases given.  
2. Give a minimal test set that satisfies all uses coverage.  
3. Give a minimal test set that satisfies all du-paths coverage.  

## Answer
### 1. Give a minimal test set that satisfies all defs coverage. Use the test cases given.  
We label the tests as follow: 
- t1: (ab, ab, 0)  
- t2: (ab, a, 0)  
- t3: (ab, ac, -1)  
- t4: (ab, c, -1)  
- t5: (a, bc, -1)  
- t6: (abc, bc, 1)  
- t7: (ab, b, 1)  
- t8: (abc, ba, -1)  


This test set satisfies all defs coverage:  
{t1}

### 2. Give a minimal test set that satisfies all uses coverage. 
{t1, t4, t5, t6}

### 3. Give a minimal test set that satisfies all du-paths coverage. 
{t1; t2; t3; t4; t5; t6; t7; t8}
