# Exercise 6 - Section 2.2 - Chapter 7

## Question
Answer questions a窶田 for the graph in Figure 7.2.
(a)窶キist the test requirements for Node Coverage, Edge Coverage, and Prime Path Coverage on the graph.
(b)窶キist test paths that achieve Node Coverage but not Edge Coverage on the graph.
(c)窶キist test paths that achieve Edge Coverage but not Prime Path Coverage on the graph.

### List the test requirements for Node Coverage, Edge Coverage, and Prime Path Coverage on the graph.
- Node Coverage: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}  
- Edge Coverage: {[1, 4], [1, 5], [4, 8], [5, 8], [2, 5], [5, 9], [9, 6], [6, 2], [3, 6], [3, 7], [6, 10], [7, 10]}  
- Prime Path Coverage: {[1, 4, 8], [1, 5, 8], [1, 5, 9, 6, 2], [1, 5, 9, 6, 10], [2, 5, 9, 6, 2], [2, 5, 9, 6, 10], [3, 6, 2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 2, 5, 9], [3, 6, 10], [3, 7, 10], [5, 9, 6, 2, 5], [6, 2, 5, 9, 6], [9, 6, 2, 5, 8], [9, 6, 2, 5, 9]}  

### List test paths that achieve Node Coverage but not Edge Coverage on the graph.
{[1, 4, 8], [2, 5, 9, 6, 10], [3, 7, 10]}

### List test paths that achieve Edge Coverage but not Prime Path Coverage on the graph.
{[1, 4, 8], [2, 5, 9, 6, 10], [3, 7, 10], [n0, n4, n7], [n2, n5, n1, n4, n7]}
