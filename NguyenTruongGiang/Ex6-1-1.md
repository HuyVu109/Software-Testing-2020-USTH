# Exercise 1 - Section 1 - Chapter 6

## Return to the example at the beginning of the chapter of the two characteristics “File F sorted ascending” and “File F sorted descending.” Each characteristic has two blocks. Give test case values for all four combinations of these two characteristics.

*File F sorted ascending*
- b1: TRUE
- b2: FALSE  

*File F sorted descending*
- b1: TRUE
- b2: FALSE  

We have for cases:
- TT: 1  
- TF: 1, 2  
- FT: 2, 1
- FF: 3, 5, 2
