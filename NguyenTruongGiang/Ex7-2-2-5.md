# Exercise 5 - Section 2.2 - Chapter 7

## Question
Answer questions aâ€“g for the graph defined by the following sets:
- N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- N0 = {1}
- Nf = {7}
- E = {(1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1)}
Also consider the following (candidate) test paths:
- p1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]
- p2 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 7]
- p3 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]

## Answer
### Draw the graph.
The graph is drawn using the **Graph Coverage** tool provided by the course's website. [The graph can be found here](https://cs.gmu.edu:8443/offutt/coverage/GraphCoverage?edges=1+2%0D%0A1+7%0D%0A2+3%0D%0A2+4%0D%0A3+2%0D%0A4+5%0D%0A4+6%0D%0A5+6%0D%0A6+1%0D%0A&initialNode=1&endNode=7&action=Nodes)  

### List the test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage. (Hint: You should get 12 requirements of length 2.)
1. [1,2,3]  
2. [1,2,4]  
3. [1,7]  
4. [2,3,2]  
5. [2,4,5]  
6. [2,4,6]  
7. [3,2,3]  
8. [3,2,4]  
9. [4,5,6]  
10. [4,6,1]  
11. [5,6,1]  
12. [6,1,2]  
13. [6,1,7]  

### Does the given set of test paths satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage? If not, state what is missing.
No. There is no test path that tour [3, 2, 3] and [6, 1, 2].

### Consider the simple path [3, 2, 4, 5, 6] and test path [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]. Does the test path tour the simple path directly? With a sidetrip? If so, write down the sidetrip.
No. The test path tour the simple path with a sidetrip [6, 1, 2, 4].

### List the test requirements for Node Coverage, Edge Coverage, and Prime Path Coverage on the graph.
The test requirements for:
- Node Coverage: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}  
- Edge Coverage: {[1, 2], [1, 7], [2, 3], [3, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5], [4, 6], [5, 6], [6, 1]}  
- Prime Path Coverage: {[1; 2; 4; 5; 6; 1], [1; 2; 4; 6; 1], [2; 4; 6; 1; 2], [2; 4; 5; 6; 1; 2], [3; 2; 4; 6; 1; 7], [3; 2; 4; 5; 6; 1; 7], [4; 6; 1; 2; 4], [4; 5; 6; 1; 2; 4], [4; 6; 1; 2; 3], [4; 5; 6; 1; 2; 3], [5; 6; 1; 2; 4; 5], [6; 1; 2; 4; 6], [6; 1; 2; 4; 5; 6], [3; 2; 3], [2; 3; 2]}

### List test paths from the given set that achieve Node Coverage but not Edge Coverage on the graph.
[1; 2; 3; 2; 4; 5; 6; 1; 7]  
*This path does not cover edge [4, 6]*

### List test paths from the given set that achieve Edge Coverage but not Prime Path Coverage on the graph.
{[1; 2; 3; 2; 4; 5; 6; 1; 7],  [1; 2; 4; 5; 6; 1; 7]}
