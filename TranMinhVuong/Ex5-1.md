If C1 subsumes C2,every test cases of C1 can satisfy C1 (called T1) must satisfy C2 
But there can be test cases in C2 (called T2)that don't satisfy C1 
Which means
a) T1 satisfies C2 
b) T2 doesn't necessarily satisfy C1 
c) Let's call T1 test set a test set of Light colour, T2 test set a test set of Colours
T2 may reveal an error of a non-light colour,which T1 cannot.
