a)Node Coverage {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
Edge Coverage = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 10), (7, 10),
(9, 6) }
Prime Path Coverage { [1, 4, 8], [1, 5, 8], [1, 5, 9, 6, 2], [1, 5, 9, 6, 10], [2, 5, 9, 6, 2], [2, 5, 9, 6, 10],
[3, 6, 2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 2, 5, 9], [3, 6, 10], [3, 7, 10], [5, 9, 6, 2, 5], [6, 2, 5, 9, 6], [9, 6, 2, 5, 8], [9, 6, 2, 5, 9]}
b)No test path available,as to achieve Edge Coverage it must go through both 4,5,which means it must have a edge with 1 as an end node,which doesn't exist
c)Same as b)
