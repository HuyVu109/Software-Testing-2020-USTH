a)A null array or an array with zero element
b)If all element(s) in the array is zero,then even if we reach the mutant it would not infect  
c) If the sum of all element(s) in the array is zero,then even if the mutant infects it would not propagate (For example: s + 3 + (-6) + 3 = s -3 - (-6) - 3
d) [0; 1 ;2 ; 3]
Output of non-mutated program: 6
Output of mutated program: -6
