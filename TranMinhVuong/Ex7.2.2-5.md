c){1,2,4,5,6,1,7} lacks {1,2,3} or {2,3,2} test requirements
{1,2,3,2,4,6,1,7} lacks {4,5,6} test requirements
{1,2,3,2,4,5,6,1,7} achieves test coverage
d) The sidetrip is {6,1,2,4}
e)For node coverage {1}{2}{3}{4}{5}{6}{7}
For Edge coverage  {(1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1)}
