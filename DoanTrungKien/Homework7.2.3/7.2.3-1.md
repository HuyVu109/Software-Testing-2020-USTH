Answer:

(a)

(b)

x has 6 du-paths, as enumerated below:

|i|[1,2,3|
|ii|[1,2,3,5]|
|iii|[1,2,6]|
|iv|[4,5]|
|v|[4,5,2,3]|
|vi|[4,5,2,6]|

(c)

```
The numbers in the table below correspond to the du-paths in the previous table. The table indicates wheteher each test path tours each du-path with or without a sidetrip.
```

|---|direct|with sidetrip|
|t1|i, ii|iii|
|t2|i, iv, vi|---|

(d)
```
One possible answer: {t2}

(e)

```
For all-uses, all six du-ppaths must be toured. Since the given test set does not have a
test path that directly tours either of du-paths (iii) or (v), this question is unsatisfiable.
To directly tour the given du âˆ’ paths, we would two additional test paths. An example
all-uses adequate test set (direct touring) is: {t1, t2, [1, 2, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 6]}.
