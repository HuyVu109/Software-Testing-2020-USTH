(f1) -> (f3)
(f1) -> (f2)
(f3) -> (f4)
(f3) -> (f5)
(f4) -> (f6)
(f5) -> (f6)
```

(b)
```
• t1: [f1, f3, f5, f6]
• t2: [f1, f3, f4, f6]
• t3: [f1, f2]
• t4: [f1, f3, f4, f6]
• t5: [f1, f2, f3, f4, f6]
```

(c)
```
Three possibilities: {t1, t2, t3}, {t1, t3, t4}, or {t1, t5}.
```

(d)
```
One possibility: {t1, t5}
```

(e)
```
There are 4 prime paths: { [f1, f2, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f2, f3, f5, f6], [f1,f3, f4, f6], [f1, f3, f5, f6] }. The second of these paths is not covered by the given test paths
