## Ex 6-1 ##
There are 4 possible cases for this example. Take the letters a,b,c as the input values:

1. TT: a
2. TF: a,b
3. FT: b,a
4. FF: a,b,c

## Ex 6-2 ##
- For **Where Made**, I think it should be more options. If these 3 continents provide most of the cars so we can add *other* to choose when cars are made outside these continents. Or just state others continents.

- *Hatchback* is a (optional) component of a car but doors are always there so we don't need to state *Hatchback*  as partitioning of **Size**. If need, we can made it be an characteristic with  02 parts *yes, no*.
