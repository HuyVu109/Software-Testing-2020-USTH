# a)
For example  a list ( [1,3,1], 1) is belong in both Block 1 and Block 3 => Fails the disjointness property
# b)
For example a list ( [1,3,1], 0) will return -1 but then Block 1 Block 2 and Block 3 doesn't have that kind of result => Fails the completness property.
# c)
* Block 1: Element is in the first or the last position.
* Block 2: Element is in the middle of the list.
* Block 3: Element is not in the list.
