# a) 
* p2 and  p3 is the tested path
* p1 is not since its not end with Nf
* p4 is not since its doesn't start with N0
* p5 is not since there is no path (3,2)
# b)
* (1,2,1) (1,2,3) (1,3,1) (2,1,2) (2,1,3) (2,3,1) (3,1,2) (3,1,3)
# c)
The missing state are (2,1,2) and (3,1,3)
# d) 
p2 tour the prime path with a sidetrip {2}
