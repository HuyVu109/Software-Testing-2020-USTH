# a)
The set do sastify the completeness property.

# b)
However they are not sastify the disjointness property since a null set is pretty much a empty set.

# c)

Same as the above characteristic, they do sastify the completeness property.
# d)

However once again, there are disjoint at "s1 and s2 represent the same set" and "s1 and s2 do not have any elements in common". Example let s1={} and s2={}. They don't have any elements and still represent the same set.

# e) 
If the "Base Choice" were applied there will be 6 tests needed. Let 3 characteristic of set 1 are 1 2 3, 4 characteristic of set 2 are A, B, C, D. Let 1 and A be the base case then the test needed are:
* A 1
* A 2
* A 3
* 1 B
* 1 C
* 1 D
