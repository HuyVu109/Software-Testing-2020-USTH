# The code (mutant included):
```Java
public static int findVal(int numbers[], int val)       
   {                                                       
      int findVal = -1;                                    
      for (int i=1; i<numbers.length; i++)                 
         if (numbers [i] == val)
         {
            findVal = i;     
         }
      return (findVal);                                    
   }
```

# a and b
Both case are imposible to find such test case since the program must run through the whole string.

# c and d
* c find 1 in {-1,1}
* d find 1 in {1,0}
