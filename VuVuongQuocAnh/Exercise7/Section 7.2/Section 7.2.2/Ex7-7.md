# 7-7.

a) p2, p3, p5 are test paths.

​	p1 is not test path because it's end-node is not the final node.

​	p4 is not test path because it's start-node is not the initial node.

b) Edge-Pair Coverage: TR = {(1, 3, 1), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 2), (3, 1, 3), (3, 1, 2), (2, 3, 1), (2, 1, 3)}

c) These test paths doesn't satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage. (2, 1, 2) and (3, 1, 3) are missing.

d) p2 tour the prime path with a side trip [1, 2, 3].
