- Node Coverage: TR = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Edge Coverage:  TR = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 7), (7, 4), (5, 6), (4, 8), (6, 8), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 2), (2, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 11), (11, 13)}
  - Prime Path Coverage: TR = {[1, 2, 10, 11, 13], [11, 12, 11], [12, 11, 12], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 2], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 2], [2, 3, 4, 8, 2], [2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], [4, 5, 7, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 2, 10, 11, 13], [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 2, 10, 11, 13], [5, 7, 4, 8, 2, 10, 11, 13], [5, 7, 4, 8, 9, 2, 10, 11, 13]}

e. Node Coverage: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 2, 10, 11, 12, 11,13]

d. Edge Coverage: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 2, 10, 11, 12, 11, 13] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 2, 10, 11, 13]
