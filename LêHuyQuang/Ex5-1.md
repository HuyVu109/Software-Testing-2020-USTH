5-1,

a, T1 necessarily satisfy C2, because it's directly from the definition of subsumption.

b, T2 doesn't necessarily C1, because Test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2

c, T2 contains that one test that reveals the fault, and T1 doesn't because subsumption is about criteria, not about test sets. There is no requirement that test set T2 be a subset of test set T1.
