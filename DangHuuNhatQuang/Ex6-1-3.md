a) “Location of element in list” fails the disjointness property is true since disjointess property states that no element of domain is in more than one block.

b) “Location of element in list” fails the completeness property is true since it the partition can't cover the entire domain.

c) Splitting into two characteristics, namely first entry and last entry, solves the problem.
