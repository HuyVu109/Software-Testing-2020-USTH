Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures Looking for failures is a negative activity
Level 3 testing shows the presence, not absence or failure. If we use software, we expose some risk.
Level 4 testing means that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to produce high quality software. A mental discipline that increases quality:
Test engineers can become technical leaders of the project
So from those describe above we can think of some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality) like :
experience
responsibility
expertise
technical
skills
Good teamwork and communication to lead
