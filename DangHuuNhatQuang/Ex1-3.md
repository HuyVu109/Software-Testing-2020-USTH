What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?”

Is to know more faults therefor to reduce risk in the future.

The risk are:
+ High cost of repairing
+ High pressure on personnel
+ Can we reduce the risk to zero?

I think we cannot. Because in work we have so many stages and each stage have another people do. Sometime maybe they are conflicted between people.
