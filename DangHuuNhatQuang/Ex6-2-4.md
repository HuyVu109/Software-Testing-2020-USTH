a) The partition “Validity of s1” satisfy the completeness property since it covers the entire domain as Set s1 can either be null or empty or has at least 1 element in it.
b) The partition “Validity of s1” satisfy the disjointness property since no value of Set s1 can qualify for more than 1 condition(null, empty or have at least one element).
c) The partition “Relation between s1 and s2” satisfy the completeness property since if s1,s2 are not null sets then there can't be any condition outside the given four.
d) The partition “Relation between s1 and s2” doesn't satisfy the disjointness property: When s1 and s2 are empty set then the relation is considered either represent the same
set or do not have any elements in common.
e) We will have 5 additional tests:
Call the characteristics a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, b4 simultaneously 
Choose (a1, b1) as the base choice test:
We have:
(a2, b1), (a3, b1), (a1, b2), (a1, b3), (a1, b4)
