Return to the example at the beginning of the chapter of the two
characteristics “File F sorted ascending” and “File F sorted
descending.” Each characteristic has two blocks. Give test case values
for all four combinations of these two characteristics.

Solution:
| Test case # | F | sorted ascending | sorted descending |
|-------------|:---:|:------------------:|-------------------|
|      1      |{0}|         T         |        T           |
|      2      | {1, 3, 2, 4}  |      F            |        F           |
|      3      |  {1, 2, 3, 4} |         T         |          F         |
|      4      |  {4, 3, 2, 1} |         F         |           T        |
