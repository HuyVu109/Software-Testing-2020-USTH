Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that
test set T1 satises C1 on program P and test set T2 satises C2, also on P.

a. Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.
```
Yes. This follows directly from the denition of subsumption.
```
b. Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.

```
No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satised by
T2.
```
c. If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the
fault. Explain.

```
No. This is the hard question. Students often think that test sets for strong criteria are
at least as good at nding faults as test sets for weaker criteria. But subsumption is
about criteria, not about test sets. In particular, there is no requirement that test set T2
be a subset of test set T1. So, it could happen that T2 contains that one test that reveals
the fault, and T1 doesn't.
